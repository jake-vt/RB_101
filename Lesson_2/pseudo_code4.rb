### - A method that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of 
### - a given character in a string. For instance: 
### -     the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', 
          the method should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x')
### - If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return 'nil'.

1) Invite and accept a long string from the user
2) Invite and accept the target character
3) Locate the 3rd instance of the target character
4) Print the index of this instance
